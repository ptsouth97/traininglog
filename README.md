# Training Log Analysis

## Overview
This application's purpose is to analyze data from a runner's training log

The application was tested using Python 3.6.6 running on Ubuntu and relies on:
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## How it works

1. Correlations 
	1. Question 1: Does higher cadence correlate with higher pace?
	2. Question 2: Does vertical oscillation correlate with higher pace?
2. Changes Over Time
	1. Question 1: How has weight changed over time?
